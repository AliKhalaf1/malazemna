# Student Scenario

## Application Experience

	Ahmed, a dedicated medical school student in Cairo,
	is excited to explore the new application that could
	potentially streamline his academic life.
	He downloads the app on his smartphone and registers
	using his email. The onboarding process is
	straightforward, and he appreciates the simple,
	user-friendly interface.

	Upon logging in, Ahmed finds the main dashboard,
	which is the digital library system that contains
	the available libraries.

### Ordering Printables:
    Ahmed navigates to the digital libraries and discovers
    that he can now order printables from a specific library
    right through the app. He can search for the required printables
    and documents, check their availability, and place an order
    with a simple click. This feature delights him as it eliminates
    the need to physically visit the library and wait in long queues.

### Notifications:
    Ahmed places an order for some crucial printables required for
    his next week's coursework. His email is verified so when
    a printable is ready he can recieve a notification through his email.
    This way, he can be informed as soon as the printables are ready
    for pickup. The notification feature is convenient for him,
    as he can manage his time more effectively.

## Unavailable Printables:

    Ahmed wants to order the most recent malzma from his doctor before the exam, but when he tried to place an order for it, it was out of stock, so he added it to his bookmarks to buy it later.
