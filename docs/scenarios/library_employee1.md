# Library employee 1 scenarios

## Dashboard

- Soso starts her shift at the library by opening up the application dashboard
- The dashboard has useful information for soso like total orders completed from the pending ones (ex 8/12)
- The dashboard displays the printer status, perhaps information about ink status or which printing profile is selected
- The dashboard has options to see past orders
- The dashboard displays some statistics on the most ordered malazem
- The dashboard displays the malazem which are low in stock or out of stock so that soso can print them
- The dashboard has quick buttons to other views like order list, upload malzma view, settings, printing status, library account

## Order list

- Soso's eyes instantly look at the order count on her dashboard to check if there are pending orders
- Soso clicks on the orders icon and is presented by a chronological list of orders
- Soso can see each order by priority, time ordered, client's ID/ name, total number of papers, and estimated print cost
- Soso notices large orders which have large sub-items and manually adjusts their priority (like torrent lists?)
- Soso has the option to print individual orders by hovering over the order and the order button appears to start printing
- Soso has the option to print all orders according to the priority (default prio is time ordered) by clicking a single button

## Upload malzma view

- Dr. Ahmed Hamdy has a new malzma for advanced algorithms so he goes to soso and gives it to her so she can upload it
- Soso clicks the back button and returns to the dashboard where she clicks the button to upload a new malzma to her library
- Soso is presented by an empty window with a button to prompt her to start scanning
- Soso scans each page in order and each scanned page shows up on the window like a photo gallery
- The pages are numbered so that soso makes sure shes scanning in order
- Soso is stupid so she scans multiple pages out of order
- After soso finishes scanning, she realizes her mistake and just drags the page to the correct order
- Soso remembers to put the library logo as a watermark on all pages and clicks a button which lets her select a watermark image
- Soso sees the pages rendered with watermarks
- Soso attaches a new page from the desktop as the cover page
- Soso clicks next and sets the price, name, description, and related info then clicks post

## Printer view

- Soso decides to start printing orders so she clicks back to the dashboard and clicks on the printer icon
- Soso sees a window split into 3 sections: one for pending orders, one for currently printing orders, and another for finished orders
- Soso clicks start on the first pending order and the printing starts automatically and the item is moved to currently printing
- Soso doesnt have to setup the printer settings because she is stupid and doesnt know english, the customers already choose their settings and the printer automatically receives the printing settings when soso clicks print (is this possible?????)
- She keeps adding more orders until all of the printers are occupied, an indicator lights up/print buttons are greyed out to indicate that soso cant print until the current orders finish
