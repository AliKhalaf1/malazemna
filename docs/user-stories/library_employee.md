# Library Employee User Stories

## Login with Credentials

As a library employee, I want to login to my account using my credentials.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The library employee can login using their email and password.

## View Dashboard

As Soso, I want to open the application dashboard at the start of my shift, so I can view useful information such as the total completed orders, printer status, statistics on most ordered malazem, and items low or out of stock. Additionally, I want quick access buttons to other views like order list, upload malzma view, settings, printing status, and library account.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The library employee can view the total completed orders.
- [ ] The library employee can view the printer status.
- [ ] The library employee can view statistics on most ordered malazem.
- [ ] The library employee can view items low or out of stock.
- [ ] The library employee can access other views.

## Order List

As Soso, I want to view the number of pending orders on the dashboard to quickly check for any pending tasks. When I click on the orders icon, I expect to see a chronological list of orders with details like priority, time ordered, client's ID/name, total number of papers, and estimated print cost. If there are large orders with sub-items, I want the ability to manually adjust their priority. I should also have the option to print individual orders by hovering over them or print all orders according to priority with a single click.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The library employee can view the number of pending orders on the dashboard.
- [ ] The library employee can view a chronological list of orders.
- [ ] The library employee can view details of each order.
- [ ] The library employee can manually adjust the priority of large orders.

## Upload Malzma View

As Soso, I want to upload a new malzma to my library. I expect to be presented with an empty window with a button to prompt me to start scanning. When I scan each page, I expect to see the pages rendered like a photo gallery. I should be able to drag pages to the correct order if I scan them out of order. I should also be able to add a watermark to all pages and attach a cover page.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The library employee can upload a new malzma to their library.
- [ ] The library employee can scan each page.
- [ ] The library employee can drag pages to the correct order.
- [ ] The library employee can add a watermark to all pages.
- [ ] The library employee can attach a cover page.

## Printer View

As Soso, I want to start printing orders. I expect to see a window split into 3 sections: one for pending orders, one for currently printing orders, and another for finished orders. When I click start on the first pending order, I expect the printing to start automatically and the item to be moved to currently printing. I should not have to setup the printer settings because the customers already choose their settings and the printer automatically receives the printing settings when I click print.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The library employee can start printing orders.
- [ ] The library employee can view pending orders.
- [ ] The library employee can view currently printing orders.
- [ ] The library employee can view finished orders.
